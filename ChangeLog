History
=============
dd.mm.yyyy
14.02.2013
	* change queries with hardwareID

02.08.2012
	* got rid of the FindNextLapOffset function (rcx5)

12.04.2012
	* fixed datalnk root access -> add a udev rule

24.03.2012
	* started with pdd file creation (class files)

22.03.2012
	* fixed s625x si units
	* improved speed calcualtion (s625x)

29.02.2012
	* fixed bug at setting working dir. (define extern value)

10.02.2012
	* enhanced pairing sequenc

06.02.2012
	* sticked rcx5 sessions correct together

02.02.2012
	* started session parsing rcx5

14.01.2012
	* rcx5: get overview, find watch, get session - functions implemented

07.01.2012
	* init Datalnk device works (led flashing)

02.01.2012
	* gpx file gets write out (only implemented when reading a raw file with -r option)
	* configure checks for installed libxml2 and libusb (future use for datalnk support)
	* initial rcx5 driver implementation (search for usb device)

12.12.2011
	* started building a shared lib & seperating the cli(command line interface)
	* wrote a application to simulate an HRM device.
	* hacked the gps encoding (need to review)

24.11.2011
	* added gps sample data (was not sucsessful parsing data)

14.11.2011
	* setup git source code management

11.11.2011
	* I recognized a bug with parsing the laps. the number_of_laps value is 
bcd coded. (fixed this S625X)
	* declared parseRawSessions and find_minimum as static class members to solve name conflicts.
	* get raw data out of the rs800cx and store them in a nodelist, and write out raw file
	* started parsing rs800cx session data and write a doc file
	* rewrite the list of supported devices (polarhrm_config.h)
	* adapted the selection function at polarhrm.cpp (enum switch )


10.10.2011
	* create the "orginal" hrm filename. YYMMDDxx.hrm (xx is the session day counter starting at 01)
	* implemented an erase function (./polarhrm s625x -e) deletes ALL the sessions stored at the device. (experimental)
	* adapted the bcd function and added unbcd function.
	* copied s625x code to rs800cx code to start implementation (./polarhrm rs800cx) - runs getOverview (shows session number & used bytes) 
	*  it figured out that there are some name conflicts, so I need to think to put redundat code into classes or do namespaces.
	* started replaceing the selfwritten nodelist (used at c program) and use the STL list class instead. 
	*  (created a Datanode class that holds an array with it's len)

09.09.2011
	* software does not need the DRIVER parameter any more. The driver is stored in class and gets cleated by constructor.
	* uml model (http://bouml.free.fr)
	* to get an idea of how it should work ;-)
	* started writing limit levels to hrm file.
	* fixed duration thenth of second


09.08.2011
	* started designing c++ class model

07.08.2011
	* fixed issue with parsing more sessions at once. reset global values lap_byte_size, and sample size for every session
	* changed raw saving process. now data is saved with a tempname given in polarhrm.h before parsing the session, 
	  after parsing it gets renamed. (in case the function crashes we have the raw data)
	
	* structured source code. each watch gets its own subdir (general fuctions are in src/)


02.08.2011 
	* first HRM files can be wirtten (yeppe!)

27.07.2011
	* added commandline options. (not all have an impact by now)
	* fixed the speed calcualtion, display altitude values. 
	* cleaned up code
	* now can save raw data. 
	* (cycling data raw and hrm would be fine)


02.06.2011 
	* parsing session information according S710 Information. 
	* Many things are working like the same. some differences.


24.05.2011
	* get raw session data out of the watch
